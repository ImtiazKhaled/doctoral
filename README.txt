Project 1 Phase 3 Web Interface

We have created our web interface using react.js. Also,
rather than connecting directly to our MySQL Server, the website 
will communicate via HTTP request with a server, written in node.js.
If you really want to run this yourself, you should npm install on
both directories and npm start in both directories. Also, you will need
to change the endpoint locations to localhost and whichever port
you want to host the server on. 

This can be done by changing the variable "location" inside locations.js
in this directory.
